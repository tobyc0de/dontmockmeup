      <h2>Short<span>(ish)</span> bio</h2>
      <p>
        I was born in <strong>Munich</strong> and lived there for about 8 years, until my family (I have 2 older brothers)
        moved to a small, dreamy town called Miltenberg. This was my bedroom
        window, believe it or not: <br />
        <img src="./media/house.png" alt="my house" id="houseimage" />
      </p>
      <p>
        When I finished school, i moved to Fribourg, Switzerland to study
        <strong>Communication and Media Science</strong> - 50% of my courses were in French,
        which was very hard. So I moved back to Munich after a few years and
        finished my <strong>Bachelors in Media Management<strong> there.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started doing some freelance <strong>Online Marketing</strong> work during my studies,
        and then had my first proper jobs in Marketing after. Since I was
        interested in <strong>E-learning and Online Publishing</strong>, I first joined a startup company called Pinktum, who make video courses and then switched to
        projektmagazin, a platform offering articles, courses and lots of other
        resources for project managers and other people involved in projects. 
      </p>
        <p>I started as a full on Digital Marketing Manager, but my role soon evolved
        into a hybrid between Marketing and being a <strong>Product Owner</strong> - working with our external Development Teams on the website, coming up with new features
        or improvements, working with different teams to understand their processes and requirements, writing User Stories and bug reports, planning Sprints and testing new features.
      </p>
      <p>
        In <strong>2019, I moved to the UK</strong> to live with my girlfriend after a few years of long-distance relationship. So I became self-employed, but continued
        to mostly work for projektmagazin as an external consultant. And that's
        where we are now!
